# selfhosted-templates-rpi

Just messing around with selfhosted_templates found at https://github.com/SelfhostedPro/selfhosted_templates to clean up and fix a few things to work with the Raspberry Pi 4 and Portainer 2.x.  Currently testing it out with Raspberry Pi OS lite 64bit.

Minor changes made from the main project:
* Updated Sonarr to ver v3
* Changed YoutubeDL-Material to use ARM version
* Set all PGUID and PGID to "1000" 
* Standardized host bindings folders
* Change all host folders to lowecase
* Update images, replace missing images
